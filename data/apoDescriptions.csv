200,Improving Indigenous completion rates in mainstream TAFE: an action research,"Indigenous engagement with vocational education and training (VET) has improved significantly, but successful Indigenous completion rates are lower nationally when compared to the overall population. In this report, based on an action research project,  Jo Balatti, Lyn Gargano, Martha Goldman, Gary Wood and Julie Woodlock examine intra-institutional factors at four Queensland TAFE institutes to better understand and take action on issues affecting Indigenous completion rates. At policy level, the authors conclude mainstream programs require examination at three levels - intellectual, cultural and social - to develop effective responses to facilitate successful Indigenous completion rates. At organisation level, the authors recommend examination of organisational culture for consistency of values and beliefs, and practices in terms of content, teaching, support, and collaboration.

248,Trapped in the Aboriginal reality show,"The very public debate about child abuse is like Baudrillard's 'war porn'. It has parodied the horrible suffering of Aboriginal people. The crisis in Aboriginal society is now a public spectacle, played out in a vast 'reality show' through the media, parliaments, public service and the Aboriginal world. This obscene and pornographic spectacle shifts attention away from everyday lived crisis that many Aboriginal people endure – or do not, dying as they do at excessive rates.

418,Commonwealth expenditure on Indigenous affairs 1968-2004,"Identifiable Commonwealth expenditure in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs began with the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs soon after the landmark referendum in 1967. Over the past decade, John Gardiner-Garden finds, per-capita expenditure on Indingenous Australians (once adjusted to reflect their under-utlisation iof other programs) is not significantly higher than expenditure on non-Indigenous Australians.

443,Patterns of Indigenous job search activity,"Boyd Hunter and Matthew Gray provide the first ever baseline of data on the job search behaviour of Indigenous job seekers and how it compares to the job search of non-Indigenous job seekers, with clear differences between these groups. Indigenous Australians rely disproportionately on friends and relatives as a source of information about jobs, although their networks tend to have fewer employed members and therefore are of less value than those of non-Indigenous job seekers. Non-Indigenous job seekers are more likely to use more proactive search methods than are Indigenous job seekers.

458,"Experimental estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2006","Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population has reached 517,000 or 2.5% of the total Australian population. The figures in this report are final estimates of the Indigenous population as at 30 June 2006.Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population has reached 517,000 or 2.5% of the total Australian population. These figures are final estimates of the Indigenous population as at 30 June 2006.
 Of Australia's Indigenous peoples, 90% (463,700 people) identify as being of Aboriginal origin, 6% (33,300) of Torres Strait Islander origin and 4% (20,100) as being of both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin.
 New South Wales (152,700) and Queensland (144,900) had the largest Indigenous populations while the Australian Capital Territory had the smallest (4,300). Indigenous people comprised 30% of the population of the Northern Territory.
 At 30 June 2006, around one-third of all Indigenous Australians lived in Major Cities of Australia (32% or 165,800 people). A further 21% (110,600 people) lived in Inner Regional Australia and 22% (113,300 people) in Outer Regional Australia. The remainder lived in Remote Australia (9% or 47,900 people) or Very Remote Australia (15% or 79,500 people).
 The Indigenous population has a younger age structure than the non-Indigenous population, with larger proportions of young people and smaller proportions of older people. The median age of the Indigenous population at 30 June 2006 was 21 years, compared to 37 years for the non-Indigenous population.

592,Data quality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identification,"This report examines the quality of identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients in seven data collections. The analyses focused firstly on the extent to which Indigenous status was missing or not stated in each data collection and, secondly (where possible) whether improvements in data quality had occurred over time. Thirdly, variations in data quality were explored in relation to particular groups of clients (e.g. age, sex, or service type) and by geographic location.

894,Lessons learnt about strengthening Indigenous families and communities,"The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy 2000–2004 was an Australian Government initiative funded by the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS) to help build family and community capacity to deal with challenges and take advantage of opportunities. In 2002, a consortium led by CIRCLE (the Collaborative Institute for Research Consulting and Learning in Evaluation) at RMIT University was commissioned by FaCS to undertake a national evaluation of the Strategy.
This report discusses what has been learned from the Strategy 2000–04 about how to strengthen Indigenous families and communities. These lessons have implications for future interventions funded through the Strategy 2004–09, and through other funding initiatives and programs. The report provides insights into critical factors that explain the success of some projects and some of the frustrations experienced by others.

991,Indigenous job search success,"One important and under-researched aspect of labour market policy is the extent to which policy interventions are effective in modifying job search behaviour. Furthermore, there is little extant research on whether certain job search behaviours lead to labour market success. Matthew Gray and Boyd Hunter's analysis uses the only large-scale longitudinal survey of Indigenous Australians to examine the effects of job search behaviour. One major finding is that the introduction of the Job Search Diary during the survey period was effective in increasing search intensity - but this increase in intensity did not result in increased employment rates.

1110,Culture and wellbeing: the case of Indigenous Australians,"A recurring theme in the debate surrounding Indigenous affairs in Australia is a tension between maintenance of Indigenous culture and the achievement of ‘equity’ in socioeconomic outcomes: essentially ‘self-determination’ versus ‘assimilation’. Implicit in this tension is the view that attachment to traditional culture and lifestyles is a hindrance to the achievement of ‘mainstream’ economic goals.
This paper argues the need for a renewed focus on the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians, and for empirical evidence on the link between culture and socio-economic wellbeing instead of ideological debate. Using data from National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, a strong attachment to traditional culture is found to enhance outcomes across a range of socioeconomic indicators. This suggests Indigenous culture should be viewed as a potential part of the solution to Indigenous disadvantage in Australia, and not as part of the problem.

Better services are important but will only go so far in addressing entrenched socio-economic problems. What is needed in concert with better services, is a rebuilding of the social norms which form the foundation of a healthy society.

2311,On the move? Indigenous temporary mobility practices in Australia,"This paper draws together the disparate body of existing research regarding Indigenous temporary mobilities to build a more comprehensive picture of these population dynamics and their policy implications. 

A range of Indigenous population dynamics play out underneath the demographic picture that can be constructed from official statistics. Primary among these are temporary mobility practices. Although temporary movements are largely ‘uncaptured’ by conventional statistical measures, they are pervasive in public life and thought. Words like ‘walkabout’ and ‘nomadic’ are commonly used in public discourse to characterise Indigenous people as highly mobile over the short-term, and such movement is regularly constructed as problematic for mainstream health, education and housing providers.
This paper describes the temporal, spatial and demographic dimensions of Indigenous temporary mobilities, analyses the key contextual factors that shape them, and outlines how these population dynamics relate to the governing state. The paper concludes with an exploratory discussion of the policy options and implications relating to Indigenous temporary mobility. It outlines a number of areas that require further research and proposes productive ways forward as policy makers and service providers seek to more actively and intentionally engage with Indigenous temporary mobility practices.

2629,"Why the Northern Territory Government needs to support Outstations/Homelands in the Aboriginal, Northern Territory and national interest","The development of a Northern Territory outstation/homelands policy which meets the needs and aspirations of a dynamic and highly mobile population is extremely important. It is a complex and difficult task, but one which provides an important opportunity for outstations/homelands to be viewed as an integral component of the Northern Territory Government’s vision for ‘a framework for a sustainable future where development takes place within a context of land and sea conservation’ as envisaged in the Northern Territory Parks and Conservation Masterplan 2005. 
 An innovative outstation/homeland policy which solves the problem of government service delivery of Indigenous  Australians’ citizenship entitlements -- so that it provides a choice for Indigenous Australians where they want to  live and how they want to engage nationally and internationally in social, cultural and economic life -- is urgently needed.

However, of those who are hospitalised with a disease of the digestive system, Indigenous people are less likely to have a procedure recorded than other Australians. The aim of this study was to examine patterns of undergoing a procedure for diseases of the digestive tract once in hospital for Indigenous Australians compared with other Australians, after adjustment for a number of explanatory variables.

3402,Indigenous early learning and care,"Good quality Indigenous early learning and care can ameliorate the significant health, social, economic and political disadvantages experienced by Indigenous people in Australia.
Successful programs and services include those which emphasise the importance of Indigenous history and culture, Indigenous community control, and respectful supportive relationships between Indigenous and non- Indigenous people in order to provide quality, holistic early learning and care programs and services.
While all quality, inclusive early learning and care, should meet the needs of all the children it serves, most Indigenous and many non-Indigenous education professionals suggest that currently Indigenous specific services are best able to deliver culturally safe and strong care and learning environments. There is some evidence of promising practice among mainstream early intervention programs adapted for Indigenous children and families in different parts of Australia, Rigorous evaluation of both types of programs are required to determine their relative efficacy.

3494,Factors associated with internal migration for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians,"Enhancing migration and mobility has been put forward as a solution to Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. To assess the feasibility of this suggestion, Nicholas Biddle and Boyd Hunter examine patterns of migration and factors associated with both the decision to move and the choice of destination. The results suggest that Indigenous Australians are less responsive to local economic factors than other Australians, and social and cultural factors appear to play a particularly significant role in their decision making.

3768,Lives of diversity: Indigenous Australia,"The national picture is one of difference between the lives of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians across nearly all the Census dimensions. The Indigenous population is significantly younger and growing at a faster rate; the economic items reveal broad-scale division; cultural differences are apparent around language and family life and there are discernible disconnections across the spatial dimensions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous lives.
But this aggregate perspective does not tell the full diversity story. An Australian Indigenous population analytical base, with its national patterns and trends, obscures the broader diversity of Indigenous lives. Standard disaggregation to state and territory level elicits the same limitations. While Indigenous lives are obviously lived within national and state and territory boundaries, it is their locations in specific places and spaces that most influence their shape, context and circumstances. Geographical place, at the level of the town, the region, the sector of the city or the community, is central to the conditions and milieus in which those lives are lived. For most Indigenous Australians, such locations are urban.
While media and public understandings are firmly directed towards discrete Indigenous communities, with an emphasis on the remote, most reside outside such places. Sydney is the place with the largest Indigenous population and the primary sites of current population increase are the cities of Brisbane, Broome and Coffs Harbour, not remote communities in the Northern Territory or Western Australia. Yes, Indigenous people remain significantly more likely to live in remote areas than other Australians, but nearly a third live in metropolitan areas, nearly half reside in regional areas and only a little over one quarter live their lives in remote sites. Indigenous individuals, families and communities have been urban residents since early colonial times and overall population trends indicate an ongoing Indigenous drift to the larger urban centres.
This is the second in a series of essays based on data from the 2006 Census, produced in cooperation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

3925,Caring for country: An overview of Aboriginal land management in the Top End of the Northern Territory,"Aboriginal People in the tropical savannah of the Northern Territory (NT) own 170,000 square kilometers of land including 85% of the coastline. Land and sea country have great cultural, economic and social significance to Aboriginal people, underpinning their culture and society. Aboriginal landowners continue to be reliant on the natural environment for both spiritual and physical well-being. Creation ancestors form part of a living landscape and practices such as hunting, foraging, burning, caring for sacred sites and ceremony have an important place in contemporary Aboriginal life. These practices ensure the maintenance of spiritual, cultural and economic connections to land and sea.
 From a scientific perspective these lands are some of the most biologically diverse and intact in the Northern Territory (and Australia). They support important biological values including nationally and internationally significant wetlands, migratory seabird and shorebird habitats and marine turtle nesting sites, rare and threatened species and endemic species. Many of these values are either very poorly represented or not represented at all in the Northern Territory's park system. Of the 23 bioregions represented in the Northern Territory, about one third occur predominantly on Aboriginal land.
 Owning and managing lands of such significance brings with it many diverse challenges. In the mid 1990s, to better meet these challenges, Aboriginal traditional landowners in the tropical savannah of the NT began to formalise their land and sea management activities through the establishment of the Caring for Country programme or what are commonly referred to as ranger groups.
 To date the Caring for Country programme has grown to include over 36 groups with up to 400 Aboriginal people employed in land and sea management. This seminar provides an overview of the Caring for Country Programme and examines how and why it works, as well as, what some of the challenges are that the programme faces.

3991,Indigenous social exclusion: Insights and challenges for the concept of social inclusion,"The terms social exclusion and social inclusion originated in Europe (especially  France) and were intended to provide a contrast to the notion of poverty which  focussed excessively on the lack of money at a particular point of time, rather than  the dynamic social processes that perpetuate the lack of social participation and  contribution to the workings of society. In a sense it is an  attempt to create a positive agenda for social policy, but it can be no less culturally  specific than the notion of poverty. Each nation (and communities within nations)  can have its own view about what constitutes a good society. 
 Indigenous people are among the most socially excluded in Australia and Indigenous disadvantage is multidimensional, differing from other forms of poverty in Australia in the incidence and depth of disadvantage experienced.

4339,Yolngu studies: A case study of Aboriginal community engagement,"The Yolngu studies program at Charles Darwin University has been active in the teaching of Yolngu (East Arnhemland Aboriginal) languages and culture, in collaborative transdisciplinary research, and in community engagement for well over ten years. The original undergraduate teaching program was set up under the guidance of Yolngu elders. They instituted key principles for the tertiary level teaching of Yolngu languages and culture, which reflected protocols for knowledge production and representation derived from traditional culture. These principles ensured the continuation of an ongoing community engagement practice that enabled the flourishing of a collaborative research culture in which projects were negotiated; these projects remain faithful to both western academic standards, and ancestral Aboriginal practices. The paper gives details of the program, the underlying Aboriginal philosophy, and some of the research projects. The success of the whole program can be seen to derive from the co-constitutivity of community engagement, research and teaching. In 2005 the program won the Prime Minister's award for Australia's best tertiary teaching program.

4447,The end of 'big men' politics,"Early this year I was approached by many young women, mothers, grandmothers, and those who work with them. At first I was nervous about what they may say: I knew I had stepped beyond what was expected of me in my Griffith REVIEW essay 'Trapped in the Aboriginal reality show'. I had prepared myself for hate mail and abuse, and that came, but for each abusive comment there were at least an equal number of women who contacted me and said, ‘You spoke for me’.
One woman pushed me to confront the core of the problem: ‘You and I know that the problem is big bunga politics.’ If you haven’t been in the Aboriginal world in the last thirty years, you may never have heard this phrase, but for those of us who have spent our lives fighting racism, agitating for change, for evidence-based policy, it describes something we know too well – the real politic of power in our world – power that is all too often used against women and children, power that takes many forms, and has too frequently been used for personal aggrandisement. The big bunga way – a scatological term used to refer to the ‘big man’ syndrome – works to the advantage of a few and has become normalised, and even glorified, in some circles. Meanwhile, assault, rape and an astonishing variety of other mental and physical forms of abuse have become the norm in far too many communities and families.
The symptoms of this are becoming increasingly well known – manifest in both vertical and lateral violence. At its core, there is a pattern of entrenched violence directed both against those in positions of official power, and poisonously and insidiously against those close by who have little power or capacity to respond. Violence as a proxy for power traumatises Indigenous families and communities in Australia, and in other countries that share a history of colonisation and displacement.
Vertical violence involves responses that are usually, though not always, disproportionate and dysfunctional, such as attacks on police officers, vehicles and stations. Anyone in a position of authority may be a target, as settlement battles are replayed. At times, the attacks are a response to abuses of power, but more often they are booze and dope fuelled rampages, such as the attacks which have been reported from time to time at Aurukun and Wadeye and the assaults on nurses and teachers. The usual result is that the nurses and teachers retreat, police officers are evacuated for a period of time and the gangs take over these townships, exacerbating the lawlessness, anarchy, crime and lateral violence – violence against their own.
In brief, the idea is that dissatisfaction and anger are expressed through acts of violence against the institutional supervisors, such as police, nurses and teachers. The consequences of this vicious, repetitive type of violence are that a parallel power structure evolves; the ‘big men politics’ that lie at the heart of both lateral and vertical violence that are reported much too regularly from Aboriginal Australia. It is painful and difficult to explain, but this is what I hope to do here.

Fatal and non-fatal outcomes are combined, but can be examined separately as well. This report provides details of the extent of premature mortality and disability estimated for over 170 disease and injury categories and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in remote and non-remote areas of Australia. Burden of disease analysis gives a unique perspective on health.  Fatal and non-fatal outcomes are combined, but can be examined separately as well. This report provides details of the extent of premature mortality and disability estimated for over 170 disease and injury categories and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in remote and non-remote areas of Australia. It also presents estimates of the amount of disease and injury caused by 11 major risk factors.  More importantly, it measures the Indigenous Health Gap, which is the difference between the observed burden of disease in Indigenous Australians and what it would have been if the same rates of burden of disease as in the total Australian population would have applied.
 This is of major policy interest.  The diseases and risk factors that contribute most to the Indigenous Health Gap are identified as health areas where appropriately resourced health services, combined with interventions to address the social and economic disadvantages faced by Indigenous Australians, are likely to have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of disease.

4587,Indigenous peoples and indicators of well-being: an Australian perspective on UNPFII Global Frameworks,"John Taylor outlines current Australian social indicator frameworks, including issues of statistical accountability and the politics of statistics. He discusses aspects of representations of Indigenous culture in formal reporting frameworks, and observes that the development of indicators in cross-cultural settings will always involve a degree of reductionism and a process of translation. The Programme of Action announced for the United Nation’s Second International Decade on the World’s Indigenous Peoples sets out a framework of key objectives for achievements during the decade, and this paper deals with the implication for measures of well-being from an Australian perspective.

In addressing key parts of the government's new arrangements - the National Indigenous Committee, shared responsibility agreements, and Indigenous land issues - Professor Behrendt argues that there needs to be a strong alternative vision from the ALP.

4803,2005 Indigenous engagement report,"Rod McDonald presents a model for the effective delivery of e-learning programs to Indigenous learners by registered training organisations, individuals, communities, and other organisations. The report identifies key strategies that have led to positive training outcomes with Indigenous learners and involved a comprehensive analysis of e-learning activity within Indigenous communities across Australia. The types of e-learning activity examined by the report included the application of electronic media in the delivery of training and education such as the use of web, CD-ROM or computer-based learning resources and online assessment activities. 
 Key factors leading to positive training outcomes identified in the report included ensuring community involvement and ownership, providing flexibility in program design, content and delivery, and incorporating Indigenous identities, cultures, knowledge and values into training and education programs.
 The report also reveals that there is considerable evidence of e-learning and innovation occurring within Indigenous communities at a national level, however much of this is happening in isolated pockets.   Report outcomes will be used by the Indigenous Engagement Project to develop strategies for 2006 and beyond.

4806,Working towards better practice: Indigenous engagement project 2006 - end of year forum,"The Australian Flexible Learning Framework's Indigenous Engagement Project aims to advocate the benefits of e-learning and strengthen the role of Indigenous people and communities in shaping VET provision.  The project is now in its third year. During the first two years it funded seven innovative projects which use technology to reduce barriers to Indigenous participation in education and training.
 In 2005, the Indigenous Engagement Project commissioned a report to develop strategies and opportunities for 2006 and beyond . The report revealed that there is considerable evidence of e-learning and innovation occurring within Indigenous communities, but much of this is happening in isolated pockets. 
 It recommended that, rather than participating in e-learning for e-learning’s sake, communities should spend time before embarking on an e-learning project to assess whether  e-learning can help them meet the community’s broader objectives and what methodologies will be of most benefit. 
 The 2005 report also listed some critical elements that bring positive outcomes from e-learning projects, confirming previous research on Indigenous VET undertaken by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research . 
 The outcomes of the 2005 report were used by the Indigenous Engagement Project to design the 2006 program, which included funding and support for four separate projects.  On 5 December 2006 an end of year forum was held in Brisbane to bring together the four projects and display and discuss their challenges and achievements.  
 This report, on the Indigenous Engagement Project 2006 end-of-year forum, firstly provides some information about each of the four projects involved, and draws out a theme or ‘key insight’ which came out of the project’s presentations at the forum.   The report then records some broader messages about leadership, e-learning and Indigenous programs which emerged from the forum discussion and also notes some ongoing issues faced by projects in incorporating the seven critical elements for positive outcomes.

6395,Buying the hotel: Social value or social liability for Indigenous groups?,"At the core of alcohol control policies in Australia—and indeed in any country with a system of licensing—lies a key conflict. This is the conflict between the interest of the state in reducing alcohol-related problems on the one hand, and its interest in enjoying the economic benefits produced by the alcohol beverage industry on the other. When an Indigenous corporation buys into premises licensed to sell alcohol, it is faced with a similar conflict and a moral hazard: good sales may mean more alcohol-related harms for which others largely bear the cost. This paper presents some preliminary thoughts on a new project examining the challenges for Indigenous enterprises that profit from the sale of alcohol.

8170,Monitoring 'practical' reconciliation,"Jon Altman and Boyd Hunter examine changes in the socioeconomic status of Indigenous Australians during 1991-2001, a period that closely matches 'the reconciliation decade' using census data. Comparisons are made both of change in absolute wellbeing for the total Indigenous population, and of relative wellbeing between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in five broad categories - employment, education, income, housing and health. The 'scorecard' shows that, in absolute terms, it is difficult to differentiate the performance of governments pre- and post-1996. But in relative terms - when comparing the relative wellbeing of Indigenous people as a whole with all other Australians - there is some disparity between the two periods, with the early period 1991-96 clearly outperforming the more recent period. While practical reconciliation forms the rhetorical basis for Indigenous policy development since 1996, there is no evidence that the Howard governments have delivered better outcomes for Indigenous Australians than their predecessors despite a period of rapid economic growth at the national level. It is of particular concern that some of the relative gains made between 1991 and 1996 appear to have been offset by the relatively poor performance of Indigenous outcomes between 1996 and 2001.

8196,From rhetoric to reality: can 99-year leases lead to homeownership for Indigenous communities?,"The lack of private property rights on communal title land has prevented Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders from becoming homeowners. Even for those who can afford to purchase a house, banks will not provide financing for home loans without legal title over land. But the choice to become a homeowner should be available to all Australians regardless of who they are or where they live. 
 Private homeownership provides benefits and responsibilities that are absent from communal land ownership and public housing. Owning a home may provide the incentive to get a job, stay in employment, or look for a better paying position. 
 Recognising the benefits of homeownership, the Commonwealth government established a Home Ownership on Indigenous Land (HOIL) program to enable even low income Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to purchase a home. But three years after it was initiated, only one HOIL loan has been granted. For the HOIL scheme to be properly implemented, individual land tenure arrangements need to be established.

The ABS reported that the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men is 11.5 years lower than for non-Indigenous men, while life expectancy of Indigenous women is 9.7 years lower than for non-Indigenous women.
 In releasing the data today, the ABS noted that the life expectancy estimates were derived using a new method which drew on information from the ABS Indigenous Mortality Quality Study conducted in 2006-07 as part of the Census Data Enhancement Project. The availability of that information considerably improved the quality and robustness of the estimates. Previously published Indigenous life expectancy estimates had been derived using methods based on a range of assumptions and those estimates were very sensitive to the assumptions made.
The ABS has warned that due to the considerable methodological changes, the current estimates should not be compared with the previously published 1996-2001 life expectancy estimates and the differences in the estimates should not be interpreted as changes in Indigenous life expectancy over time.
 At the state/territory level, estimates could only be compiled for New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Northern Territory. Of these New South Wales had the highest life expectancy for Indigenous men (69.9 years) and women (75.0 years). The Northern Territory had the lowest life expectancy for Indigenous men (61.5 years) and women (69.2 years).

16059,Yolngu studies: A case study of Aboriginal community engagement ,"The Yolngu studies program at Charles Darwin University has been active in the teaching of Yolngu (East Arnhemland Aboriginal) languages and culture, in collaborative transdisciplinary research, and in community engagement for well over ten years. The original undergraduate teaching program was set up under the guidance of Yolngu elders. They instituted key principles for the tertiary level teaching of Yolngu languages and culture, which reflected protocols for knowledge production and representation derived from traditional culture. These principles ensured the continuation of an ongoing community engagement practice that enabled the flourishing of a collaborative research culture in which projects were negotiated; these projects remain faithful to both western academic standards, and ancestral Aboriginal practices. The paper gives details of the program, the underlying Aboriginal philosophy, and some of the research projects. The success of the whole program can be seen to derive from the co-constitutivity of community engagement, research and teaching. In 2005 the program won the Prime Minister's award for Australia's best tertiary teaching program.

19618,Study of the expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples,"
Indigenous peoples have historically been among the poorest and most excluded and disadvantaged sector of society. A major factor contributing to the disadvantaged position of indigenous peoples is the lack of quality education - which may be defined as education that is well resourced, culturally sensitive, respectful of heritage and that takes into account history, cultural security and integrity, encompasses human rights, community and individual development, and is designed in a way that is implementable - depriving millions of indigenous children of the basic human right to education. 
International human rights law recognizes the right to education as a basic human right for everyone. When elaborating on the right to education of indigenous peoples, it is necessary to take into account two categories of human rights provisions: (a) general human rights provisions acknowledging and defining the content of the individual right to education; and (b) international standards specifically recognizing indigenous peoples’ rights, including the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

This study of an offender cohort in Queensland addressed three research questions: the proportion of Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people who had contact with the juvenile justice system and the extent of this contact; the processes used to respond to offending by Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people and any disparity based on Indigenous status; the impact of police diversion on re-contact with the juvenile justice system for Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people. While confirming Indigenous over-representation in the justice system and in court for a first offence, the study highlights the need to develop, implement and evaluate appropriate programs to reduce initiation of offending and reoffending by Indigenous young people. This paper was commissioned by the Criminology Research Council.

21431,Aboriginal communities and the police's Taskforce Themis," 
Between January and June 2009 the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA) and the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Services (CAALAS) auspiced research into policing under the NTER (‘the Intervention’), in particular the establishment of 18 new police stations in Aboriginal communities. The findings of the research are primarily based on 331 surveys of Aboriginal people in 14 of the 18 communities, and around 70 interviews with elders, community representatives, police and other service providers in those communities. This data was supplemented with statistical data from the courts and from the police.
Overall, 17% of respondents believed ‘everything’ in their communities had improved since the start of Themis; conversely 14% of respondents believed ‘nothing’ had improved. Problems that are visible in public spaces had improved the most; these were alcohol (46%) and community violence (45%); less visible crimes like marijuana use, sexual assault and stealing recorded less improvement.
Overall, 75% of respondents wanted a permanent police presence and 53% believed the police were doing a good job (compared with 59% across the NT generally according to the NTPFES Annual Report 07/08). There was a slight decrease in positive feelings towards the police since the start of Themis.
These figures hide very large differences between communities. For example, in some communities less than one fifth of people reported improvements in alcohol whereas 90% of people in other communities reported improvements. The proportion of people who believed that police were doing a good job ranged from 11% to 85%. People’s feelings about the police often underwent big changes, positive and negative, since the initial establishment of the stations. Nowhere did less than a majority want a continued police presence.
What the research highlights is the massive differences in experience with the police between different locations. In different places, police worked in different ways, targeted different crimes (though with a general focus on ‘public’ offences like alcohol, and traffic offences), and had different levels and types of engagement with the community.

23648,Understanding and preventing Indigenous offending,"Indigenous over-representation is the most significant social justice and public policy issue for the Australian and New Zealand criminal justice systems. 
Closing the gap on Indigenous overrepresentation has been identified as a priority and promoted through the National Indigenous Law and Justice Framework and Reducing Offending by Māori Projec.
This research brief reports on the data available regarding Indigenous offending patterns, and finds that over- representation is particularly acute with regard to acts intended to cause injury, public order offences, offences against justice and unlawful entry. Like other offenders, Indigenous offenders are very likely to be male, substance abusers, unemployed and poor. The legacies of colonisation, dispossession and child removal policies, such as psychological distress and social disorganisation, also appear to be risk factors. The implications of these findings for crime prevention are examined.

26678,"'I succeeded once': the Aboriginal Protectorate on the Mornington Peninsula, 1839–1840","This online book makes the work of William Thomas accessible to  anthropologists, archaeologists, historians and the descendants of the  Aboriginal people he wrote about. 

More importantly, people who live,  work, study, holiday or just have a general interest in the area from  Melbourne to Point Nepean can learn about the original inhabitants  who  walked the land before it was cleared for agriculture and urban  development. Of course, development of the Mornington Peninsula is  ongoing and this book will help those involved in development or the  management of Aboriginal cultural  heritage to identify, document and  protect Aboriginal places that may not be identifiable through  archaeological investigations alone. Marie Fels supplements Thomas's  writings with other contemporary accounts and her exhaustive historical  research sheds new light on critical events and the significant places  of the Boon Wurrung people. Of particular importance is the critical  review of information about the kidnapping of Boon Wurrung people from  the Mornington Peninsula.

29634,Indigenous arts policy: initiatives and challenges ,"The Indigenous Arts Policy Forum held on 7 October 2011 showed that issues such as cultural maintenance, ownership, copyright, protection, promotion, funding and infrastructures are among the key challenges for Indigenous art policy development. 
The Forum participants called for cultural policy responses that could serve to ensure the safeguarding of Indigenous languages and cultural expressions, regulation related to copyright, and capacity-building for Indigenous artists regarding ownership and author’s rights. The responses to the survey conducted for this report show that while Indigenous arts practices are an element of interest to different agencies, many do not have specific policy priorities, programs or funding schemes to support such practices.
While Indigenous arts policies are particularly strong in countries with significant Indigenous population, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico and Peru , support for Indigenous arts themes in many other countries is provided through specific projects or as a part of the overall policy objectives of an agency. The survey also showed that while funding for Indigenous arts has, in most cases, increased during the past ten years it remains at a moderate level.

30211,Indigenous Australian-Indonesian intermarriage,"This story of Indigenous Australian-Indonesian intermarriage is one that sheds light on the changes to citizenship entitlement in Australia and the struggles of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Asian peoples to lead their lives free from government intervention. Indonesian-Australian contacts remain relatively unknown in Australian history. Early Macassan relations with the peoples of Northern Australia, brought to light by Campbell Macknight, stands out in Australian history as a significant first contact with Asia. More recently Regina Ganter has continued the Macassan story into the twentieth century exploring encounters with northern communities across Australia. But the story of wartime disruption faced by the families of Indonesian men and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their long wait for citizenship rights has yet to be told.
As a study of Australian citizenship and marriage law, this article  discusses some of complex problems posed by this grey area of the law,  and the often incompatible regulations imposed by the separate state and  federal systems.

31555,Indigenous language usage,"This paper analyses data on those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who reported in the 2006 and 2011 Censuses of  Population and Housing that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.

The analysis shows an increase in the number of Indigenous language  speakers from 51,990 in 2006 to 60,550 in 2011. However, as the number  of people identified as being Indigenous also increased over the last  intercensal period, there was in fact a small decline in the percentage  of the relevant population speaking an Indigenous language-from  12.1 per cent to 11.6 per cent. The paper also looks at the geographic  and demographic distribution of Indigenous language usage.

32058,Victorian Aboriginal affairs framework 2013–2018,"The Victorian Government has developed a strengthened Victorian Aboriginal Affairs Framework 2013 - 2018 to bring together Government and Aboriginal community commitments and efforts and create a better future for Victoria’s Aboriginal population.
 Significantly the VAAF recognises and values Aboriginal culture, integrates government effort, identifies the accountabilities of Government departments, agencies and funded service providers. This will enable more effective monitoring and evaluation of performance.
The VAAF focuses effort and resources on six Strategic Action Areas that are central to closing the gap in Aboriginal disadvantage. Through the VAAF the Government is committing to 12 headline indicators with achievable targets.

33296,Victorian Government Aboriginal affairs report 2012,"On 22 November 2012, the Victorian Aboriginal Affairs Framework 2013 – 2018 (VAAF) was released, strengthening the Government’s commitments to Aboriginal Victorians. The VAAF builds on the previous frameworks, setting clear priorities for building opportunities and responding to the needs of Aboriginal people over the next six years. The VAAF includes strategic indicators of progress, with specific targets, to ensure a focus on priority outcomes.
Underpinned by rigorous performance and accountability, the VAAF commits to stronger engagement with Aboriginal Victorians, better coordination, improved effort and systematic performance management and reporting, driven across government by the Secretaries Leadership Group on Aboriginal Affairs.
This Report delivers on the Government’s commitment to accountability and transparency, by continuing to release a whole of government annual Aboriginal affairs report that identifies progress against commitments, including targets.
On 24 March 2011, in a clear demonstration of bipartisan support for Closing the Gap, the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, together with the Leader of the Opposition, the Shadow Spokesperson for Aboriginal Affairs, Aboriginal leaders and others, recommitted to the Close the Gap Statement of Intent at Parliament House.
The Victorian Government established four guiding principles to inform Victoria’s Aboriginal affairs policy intentions and delivery, which are now incorporated in the VAAF. These are: aspirations; accountability; engagement and inclusiveness; partnership building and a whole of community approach.
Government also set out important actions to be progressed to deliver the Government’s agenda for Aboriginal affairs. These include the development of Departmental Inclusion Action Plans, strengthening Victoria’s Aboriginal affairs framework and releasing an Aboriginal affairs report annually.
This Report outlines progress against VAAF priorities. It provides an analysis of the most recently available data and an overview of activity by Victorian Government departments up to the end of 2012.
The content of the 2012 Report aligns with the VAAF. It has a stronger emphasis on evaluation and reports against the identified targets and measures in the six VAAF Strategic Action Areas.
Progress reflects access by Aboriginal Victorians to State, Commonwealth and local government provided or funded services that are important in delivering improved outcomes for Aboriginal Victorians. Ultimately, it reflects the combined efforts of the Victorian Aboriginal community, all levels of government and other sectors.
